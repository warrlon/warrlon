** 1. Multi-page support**

The application supports multiple pages, and the controls of each page are independent of each other. You can add, delete pages and change the order of page layout in the page panel. Priority is given to the first ranked page when the application is initialized.

** 2. Mobile Pages**

Mobile pages are edited in a similar way to normal pages. When an application is initialized, it will be judged whether the mobile page is first displayed according to whether the accessing device is mobile or not. To edit the mobile page, you need to click the toolbar button to switch the editing mode.

** 3. Page Settings**

When no control is selected in the editing area, the setting panel displays the setting options of the current editing page. At present, the background color of the page and the auxiliary line of the page editing area can be set. Please try to put the control in the auxiliary line of the editing area to get the best display effect.
