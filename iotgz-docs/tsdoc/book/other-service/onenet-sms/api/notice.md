# Special note

The original SMS platform was upgraded to OneNET SMS service in the early morning of May 17, 2019. The original platform has been closed. All user data and template data have been migrated. User access to the original platform
https://open.iot.10086.cn/sms/
Use new platform services.

This upgrade has the following impact on the original users:

1. The mode of sending short message is changed from template sending to template + signature sending. After upgrading, the application template must be matched with signature and sent with a new interface.

2. The original template information has been backed up and saved. The old template sending interface can still send short messages normally. The original template information can not be modified. If you need to adjust, please use the new template signature sending interface.

3. The original template information has been copied and split into new template table and signature table. It can be invoked directly with the new interface. In addition, there may be a lot of duplication in signature, which can be deleted directly.

4. This system upgrade replaces the new console, and more functions will be updated in succession. This upgrade has caused some inconvenience and changes to all of you, please forgive me.

5. At present, there are some minor problems in the new online platform. We will repair them as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding.
