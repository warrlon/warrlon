# Service introduction

## Brief Introduction to Location Capability

OneNET platform has launched a new base station-based fast positioning capability, which provides users with efficient and accurate base station positioning services. The three networks are fully covered by 2G, 3G and 4G. The longitude and latitude information can be quickly acquired by calling API interface. The map application service of OneNET application editor provides rapid positioning development integration for developers.

- OneNET user exclusive

    OneNET LBS Base Station Location provides services for OneNET users; supports MQTT, HTTP, EDP protocol access users to use OneNET LBS services

- Full coverage of 2G/3G/4G in three networks

    OneNET LBS base station positioning covers three network base station information, and 2G/3G/4G base station positioning can be achieved.

- Visual Display Service

    With OneNET application editor, real-time display and reproduction of positioning data and trajectory can be realized. Open publishing links can be directly embedded in JSP pages to facilitate users to quickly build LBS-based Internet of Things display applications.


## Main functions

- Fast Base Station Location

    Supporting fast base station information positioning, the base station information is sent to OneNET platform through the form of data point reporting, and the platform can be immediately converted to corresponding latitude and longitude information.

- Latest Track Query

    Supports the latest location query, and obtains the latest location information of base station by calling API interface.

- Historical Track Query

    It supports the query of historical trajectory, and obtains historical trajectory information by calling API interface according to the selection of time intervals.
