** 89. How do HTTP push URLs configure validation? * *

Answer: There are detailed instructions in the official website development document. The third-party server should return to msg.
When the user completes the configuration page and clicks "Submit", the OneNET platform sends HTTP GET requests to fill in the URL address for URL verification. Examples of the forms of requests are as follows:
http://url?msg=xxx&nonce=xxx&signature=xxx
Among them, the URL is the URL that the user fills in when configuring the page. Nonce, msg, signature are used to verify the URL and token.
The token verification process is as follows:
Calculate MD5 with the values of token, nonce and MSG configured in the configuration page and encode them as Base64 string values
The Base64 string value calculated by the URL Decode in the previous step is compared with the value of the request parameter signature, and if equal, token validation is successful.
If token validation is successful, the MSG parameter value is returned to indicate that the URL validation is successful.
If the user does not want to verify token, he can choose to skip the MD5 calculation process and return the MSG parameter value directly.
