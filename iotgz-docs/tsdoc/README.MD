# OneNET Internet of Things Platform

OneNET is positioned as PaaS service, which is to build an efficient, stable and secure application platform between Internet of Things applications and real devices: facing devices, adapting to various network environments and common transmission protocols, providing fast access schemes and equipment management services for various hardware terminals; facing application layer, providing rich APIs and data distribution capabilities to meet the development of application systems in various industries. Demand makes Internet of Things enterprises focus more on the development of their own applications, instead of focusing on the environment of the device access layer, thus shortening the formation cycle of the Internet of Things system and reducing the cost of enterprise research and development, operation and maintenance.
